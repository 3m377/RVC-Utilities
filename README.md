[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)

*Latest README update: 2023-08-31*

## Introduction
Here is a list of all of my utility scripts, designed to make life easier when installing and using RVC (Retrieval Based Voice Conversion). These scripts only work on **Windows** systems and have been tested on **Windows 10**. While primarily aimed at Windows 10, any testing on different Windows versions would be highly appreciated.
## Features

- Streamlined automation of the RVC installation process (Now supports w-okada's realtime RVC voice changer client!).
- Convenient model downloads using the [Model Downloader](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1145192195914203187/downloadmodel.bat) script.
## Downloads

*Note: Availability may vary based on README update frequency.*

- [Easy RVC Installer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1147059567906271312/easy-install-rvc.bat) | A script designed to automate the RVC installation process as much as possible.
- [Model Downloader](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1145192195914203187/downloadmodel.bat) | This script is automatically downloaded when using the Easy RVC Installer script. Alternatively, it can be downloaded separately if RVC is already installed.
## Instructions

### If RVC is already installed
- Place the [Model Downloader](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1145192195914203187/downloadmodel.bat) script into the main RVC folder.

### If RVC is not yet installed
- Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed. If you don't, the installation will not work.
- Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, or the installer will not work.
- Download the [Easy RVC Installer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1147059567906271312/easy-install-rvc.bat) script and place it in your desired RVC installation folder.
- Run the script.
- When prompted, type 1 to install RVC with Mangio-RVC-Fork.
- After some time, you'll be prompted to copy the files from **Mangio-RVC-Fork** to the **RVC-Beta** folder. Please follow the prompt and click ***Replace all files in the destination*** when requested.
- If you would like to, type "y" when prompted to install EasyGUI.
- The Model Downloader will be automatically downloaded and placed in the appropriate folder; no separate download is necessary.
## Planned changes
- Update the Python script so it is fully automated
- Add support for installing Applio-RVC-Fork (and maybe other forks if I find them cool/useful)

## DISCLAIMERS
Most of this is written with the help of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), since I am not experienced enough to write this myself.

I do not own 7-Zip, nor do I claim to own it. I have only added it to the repository so that the script can easily download it.
