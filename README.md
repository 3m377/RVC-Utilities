# 3m377's RVC Utilities 
Latest README update: 2023-08-26

## Introduction
Here is a list of all of my utility scripts, designed to make life easier when installing and using RVC (Retrieval Based Voice Conversion). These are specifically designed for **Windows**, and they are only tested on **Windows 10**. If someone can test these scripts on other versions of Windows it would be greatly appreciated.
## Downloads
**These may not be up to date, it depends on if I remember to update the README**

- [Easy RVC Installer](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1145192196237180949/easy-install-rvc.bat) | This is a script designed to automate the RVC installation process as much as possible.

- [Model Downloader](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045962672300109874/1145192195914203187/downloadmodel.bat) | This script is automatically downloaded if you use the Easy RVC Installer script, however if you already have RVC installed this can be downloaded separately.
## Instructions

### If you already have RVC installed
- Place the [Model Downloader](https://huggingface.co/3m377/RVC-Utilities/resolve/main/downloadmodel.bat) script into the main RVC folder.

### If you do not have RVC installed
- Download the [Easy RVC Installer](https://huggingface.co/3m377/RVC-Utilities/resolve/main/easy-install-rvc.bat) script and place it into the folder where you want RVC to be installed.
- Run the script.
- After a while, it will prompt you to copy the files in **Mangio-RVC-Fork** to the **RVC-Beta** folder. Please do so, and when it prompts you please click ***Replace all files in the destination***
- There is no need to download the Model Downloader, it will automatically be downloaded and placed into the correct folder
